# My Design Approach

# What new design skills has work on the project helped you to craft?

Working on this project helped a lot with strengthening my ability to think in terms of spatial relations. As I am planning to make a bunch more of these scenes over time, I have also gained the ability to break down complex objects into very basic shapes. 

# What design process did you follow for your project work?

I chose to follow a more iterative design process. First off I sketched a very rough concept of the final scene. After finalizing the layout, I decided to start thinking about other items such as textures and lighting. These two pieces will help to add proper "life" and character to the scene instead of some bland lighting with no reflections. I also modularized any of the code and functions I added to make it easier down the line to adjust or reuse items as needed. 

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? 

Modular design, visual planning, and incremental refinements can be applied to basically everything one does in their programming careers or personal projects. Breaking down a requirement document into smaller and manageable steps that are easily testable and modular will be useful in any stage of the SDLC. 

# My Development Approach 

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

For this project I chose to adopt highly reusable functions for transformation of objects and lighting. I also chose to properly experiment with several types of lighting, texture combinations, and object placement choices. 


# How did iteration factor into your development?

For the entire project I stuck with finishing only one item or feature at a time and perfecting it before moving on. A good example of this philosophy would be dealing with the orthograpgic camera POV to line up properly. I had spent around an hour perfecting that specific view angle so I didn't feel the need to make changes down the line.
