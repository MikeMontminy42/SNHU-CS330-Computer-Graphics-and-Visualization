# My Design Approach

1. **What new design skills has work on the project helped you to craft?**

* Working on this project helped a lot with strengthening my ability to think in terms of spatial relations. As I am planning to make a bunch more of these scenes over time, I have also gained the ability to break down complex objects into very basic shapes. 

2.  **What design process did you follow for your project work?**

* I chose to follow a more iterative design process. First off I sketched a very rough concept of the final scene. After finalizing the layout, I decided to start thinking about other items such as textures and lighting. These two pieces will help to add proper "life" and character to the scene instead of some bland lighting with no reflections. I also modularized any of the code and functions I added to make it easier down the line to adjust or reuse items as needed. 

3.  **How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

* Modular design, visual planning, and incremental refinements can be applied to basically everything one does in their programming careers or personal projects. Breaking down a requirement document into smaller and manageable steps that are easily testable and modular will be useful in any stage of the SDLC. 

# My Development Approach 

1. **What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**

* For this project I chose to adopt highly reusable functions for transformation of objects and lighting. I also chose to properly experiment with several types of lighting, texture combinations, and object placement choices. 

2. **How did iteration factor into your development?**

* For the entire project I stuck with finishing only one item or feature at a time and perfecting it before moving on. A good example of this philosophy would be dealing with the orthograpgic camera POV to line up properly. I had spent around an hour perfecting that specific view angle so I didn't feel the need to make changes down the line. 

3. **How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?**

* At first I was putting next to no descriptive comments, and after the third milestone I realized that I had to fix it ASAP or I would be ruined for the final project. By the end of this course I was able to write minimal comments, but highly detailed ones where I knew for a fact what the code below was doing. 

# My Computer Science Goals

1. **How do computational graphics and visualizations give new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**

* Computational graphics helped me to reason with very math heavy transformations and coordinate systems for rendering 3D scenes. These skills helped drastically to improve my problem-solving skills, and will drastically assist down the line in more full-stack style courses or projects I work on. 

2. **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied to your future professional pathway?**

* Professionally these skills will be useful in areas such as simulations and data visualization. Additionally, the experience of developing these complex systems and working with OpenGL as a library will help build adaptability for any future development I work on whether in the CS field or another.
